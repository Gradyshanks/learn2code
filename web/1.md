## Let's make a repo!

What is a repo?

So basically what we are doing is following the instructions on [cute little GitHub pages website][]. I will basically copy paste those instructions below for posterity. It is a good idea to review the [cute little GitHub pages website][].

1. Make sure you are signed up for and logged into [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. [Create a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). Name it `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io`.

You should be looking at a blank repo at this point. Now let's download that repo.

1. [Download GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [install it](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/). It should be easy.
2. Sign into your GitHub account on the GitHub for desktop app
3. Once you are all set up: choose the "Clone a Repository" option and find the repo you just created. It will ask you where you want to save the repo. Pay attention to where this is.

Now your repo is on your computer! Make sure you know what folder or directory you put it in. Should be in your documents folder/directory under "GitHub"

## Add an html file to the repo

1. Let's open up [Atom][]. If you didn't already install it: install it.
2. 


## That's it!

You have a website published to https://YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io. Good job!
