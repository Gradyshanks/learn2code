This is what we will end up with:

## Let's make a repo!

What is a repo?

So basically what we are doing is following the instructions on [cute little GitHub pages website][]. I will basically copy paste those instructions below for posterity. It is a good idea to review the [cute little GitHub pages website][].

1. Make sure you are signed up for and logged into [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. [Create a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). Name it `YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io`.

You should be looking at a blank repo at this point. Now let's download that repo.

1. [Download GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [install it](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/). It should be easy.
2. Sign into your GitHub account on the GitHub for desktop app
3. Once you are all set up: choose the "Clone a Repository" option and find the repo you just created. It will ask you where you want to save the repo. Pay attention to where this is.

Now your repo is on your computer! Make sure you know what folder or directory you put it in. Should be in your documents folder/directory under "GitHub". We will call this your "project directory"

## Add an html file to the repo

1. Let's open up [Atom][]. If you didn't already install it: install it.
2. From atom open up your project directory. You should see a couple files on the left under the "Project" pane.
3. File -> New. This will open up an untitled text file. File -> save and save as "index.html"

Now you have a blank file named index.html in your project directory.

Add the following HTML to the 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Save the file of course.

Open up this file in Google Chrome. Easiest way to do this is to go to your file manager, find the project directory, right click on index.html and select open in google chrome.

You should see something like

Yay! 

## Edit the HTML

Let's edit the text a bit. So this stuff:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
.....
</body>
</html>
```

Is boilerplate code that has to be there. The following:

```html
....
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
....
```

Is our actual content code. 

Notice how the big Hello World text is wrapped with a starting `<h1>` and a closing `</h1>` tag. Everything between [`<h1>`][] and `</h1>` is turned into a heading.

Notice how the big Hello World text is wrapped with a starting `<p>` and a closing `</p>` tag. Everything between the [`<p>`][] tags is turned into a paragraph.

With that in mind let's edit it up:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Austin Pray's Webzone</h1>
  <p>Best webzone on this series of tubes</p>
  <p>Facts</p>
</body>
</html>
```

I changed the [`<h1>`][] tag as well as edited and added another [`<p>`][] tag.

For a full list of HTML tags go to here: [MDN HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). Feel free to experiment here. Add more headings, add some more paragraphs. Add some blockquotes, whatever!

There is a nice tutorial here: [MDN HTML Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

If you can find a more friendly explanation of how to edit HTML tags add it to this page yourself.

## Add some CSS Styles

So after our changes:

![spicy](https://cdn.oncarrot.com/uploads/sites/26882/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-01-10.52.39.png)

This page is looking pretty spicy. But what is up with that Times New Roman looking font? It makes the page look pretty uggo. Let's introduce a little CSS.

We have to add a `<head></head>` section after the starting `<html>` tag. And then inside that we have to add a `<style></style>` tag.

Inside our `<style>` tag we are gonna add some CSS. If you look at your HTML file do you see how all of our content is contained inside of a `<body></body>` tag? Well we wanna take all the text inside the `<body></body>` tag make it ["sans-serif"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif). So we will add the following CSS:

```css
body { font-family: sans-serif }
```

If you want to understand more I recommend [following this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics). But simply put: 

This says 
- Everything inside the `<body>` tag: `body { ... }`
- Should have it's font set to a sans-serif font: `... { font-family: sans-serif }`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style type="text/css">
    body {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Austin Pray's Webzone</h1>
  <p>Best webzone on this series of tubes</p>
  <p>Facts</p>
</body>
</html>
```

And for good measure let's change the main `<h1>` tag to some different color.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style type="text/css">
    body {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
      color: pink;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Austin Pray's Webzone</h1>
  <p>Best webzone on this series of tubes</p>
  <p>Facts</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Our page looks like

Feel free to add more styles and make things more complicated!

## Publish to GitHub Pages.

Head over to the GitHub desktop app you installed and commit your changes. You can follow [this guide](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/add-commits-github-desktop) if you need help.

Then push your changes to the remote repository by clicking the push button. [instructions are here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/push-with-github-desktop)

## That's it!

You have a website published to https://YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io. Good job!

Edit a link to your new website into the list below:
