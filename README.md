# learn2code

Hey there! Here is my attempt at teaching my friends and coworkers basic coding skills. I am going to start with basic "coding" skills and then gradually introduce actual programming.

The GitHub repo for this website lives [here](https://github.com/austinpray/learn2code).

## Prereqs

- You need [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!
- You need **a text editor**. I recommend just using [Atom](https://atom.io/) if you don't know what I am talking about.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). We will be using the Google Chrome dev tools at some point.

## Courses

### Web Course

Since web coding is very visually oriented it is a great place to start as a beginner. We will start with a basic website and then build an actual blog using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that will function similar to [my personal website](https://austinpray.com/).

**The first thing you need to do is add yourself to the list of students below!** There is a link at the bottom right of this page that lets you edit it.

<!-- Add yourself to the list below in this format: [Austin Pray](htts://github.com/austinpray) -->
<!-- If you need help with markdown have a look at: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet -->
